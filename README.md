Under the scope of [DevOps Engineer Bootcamp](https://www.patika.dev/bootcamp/protein-devops-engineer-bootcamp), which is sponsored by [Protein Tech](https://protein.tech) and organized by [Patika.dev](https://www.patika.dev), this project has been prepared by me as the Final Project.

# :clipboard: About

The endeavour of this project is to complete all given tasks. Tasks are mentioned in [Tasks](#tasks) section. In order to accomplish that; I've prepared a very simple and primitive React App. 


It is one page static web page. I accomodate the project in GitLab repository and I use GitLab CI/CD Pipeline to automatize my deployment. I deploy my React App onto AWS ECS Fargate cluster. I provision my AWS resources via Terraform. Besides of that, in case of it wants to be used, there is available Kubernetes manifest files to deploy the app manually to a Kubernetes cluster.

</br>

# :warning: Tasks

Tasks are mainly like that:
- Create a basic React.js app.
- Create a Dockerfile for your app. Try to form an image with the smallest possible size.
- Design and write a GitLab CI/CD pipeline.
- Use **Terraform** to provision the infrastructure.
- Application should be running on ECS Fargate
- Make sure to use the ideal VPC and security group settings.
- Application load balancer must be configured in front of the service.
- Write the required core Kubernetes manifest files for Kubernetes deployment.

## :star: Bonus

- Configure auto-scaling onto your Fargate instance. Scale-up when CPU is above %50 and scale-down when CPU is below %20.
- Create the proper Cloudwatch dashboards and metrics for monitoring the performance of the application.
- Draw your AWS architecture, explain the connections and relations between your configured services.
- Instead of using GitLab's shared runners, you can configure your own runner.
- Write a script that sends a notification by E-mail if the disk usage exceeds 90% in an operating system using any Linux distribution.
